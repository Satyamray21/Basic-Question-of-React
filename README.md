# Basic-Question-of-React
In this we will do basic questions of react to grap handon and have basics knoweldge.
Questions are as follows on each topic.
Certainly! Here are some practical questions in React.js to help you understand various topics, including React Router.

Basic React Concepts
Components and Props

Create a Profile component that takes name, age, and bio as props and displays them.
State Management with useState

Create a Counter component with a button to increment the count. Display the count on the screen.
Event Handling

Create a TodoList component where you can add a new todo item to the list using an input field and a button. Display the list of todos below the input field.
Conditional Rendering

Create a Login component that shows a login form if the user is not logged in, and a welcome message if the user is logged in.
Lists and Keys

Create a UserList component that renders a list of user names from an array of objects, ensuring each list item has a unique key.
Advanced React Concepts
Forms and Controlled Components

Create a ContactForm component with fields for name, email, and message. Handle form submission and log the form data to the console.
Side Effects with useEffect

Create a FetchData component that fetches data from an API when the component mounts and displays the data. Use useEffect to handle the side effect.
Custom Hooks

Create a custom hook called useLocalStorage that syncs a state variable with localStorage.
Context API

Create a theme switcher using React Context. Implement a ThemeProvider and a ThemeSwitcher component that toggles between light and dark themes.
React Router
Basic Routing

Set up React Router in your application. Create two pages, Home and About, and navigate between them using Link components.
Dynamic Routing

Create a UserProfile component that displays user information based on the user ID in the URL. Use useParams to extract the ID from the route.
Nested Routes

Create a Dashboard component with nested routes for Overview, Settings, and Profile. Use nested Route components to render these sub-routes.
Redirects and Navigation

Implement a login flow where users are redirected to a Dashboard after logging in. Use the useNavigate hook to programmatically navigate users.
Route Guards

Implement a protected route that only allows authenticated users to access certain pages. Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
Practice Projects
Simple Blog

Create a simple blog application with pages for listing posts, viewing a single post, and creating a new post. Use React Router for navigation.
E-commerce Product List

Create a product listing page that displays a list of products. Include a detail page for each product that shows more information. Use state and props to manage data.
Task Manager

Create a task manager application where users can create, update, and delete tasks. Include routing for different views like All Tasks, Completed Tasks, and Pending Tasks.
Additional Challenges
Search and Filter

Add a search bar to your UserList component to filter the list of users based on the search input.
Pagination

Implement pagination in your FetchData component to handle large datasets.
Form Validation

Add form validation to your ContactForm component to check for required fields and valid email format.
By working through these questions and projects, you'll gain practical experience with React's core concepts and tools, as well as with React Router for navigation. If you have any specific areas you'd like to dive deeper into, let me know!
